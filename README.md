# TeleLink Communications — AI-Powered Customer Churn & CLV Prediction Platform

---

# 🎯 1. Project Overview

TeleLink Communications serves over **1.2 million customers** across the United States and faces three major challenges:

- Rising customer churn (**14.2%**)  
- Difficulty forecasting long-term revenue  
- Unpredictable usage patterns affecting operational costs  

This project delivers an **end-to-end AI platform** that:

- Predicts customer churn with high sensitivity (recall-focused)  
- Estimates Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)  
- Supports strategic, data-driven retention decision-making  
- Offers a **cloud-deployed** web application for real-time analysis  
The solution integrates **classical machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **cloud technologies**.

# 📘 2. Dataset & Preprocessing 

### Key Characteristics  
- ~3,300 total records (train + test)
- 20+ features including:
  - State, Area code, International plan  
  - Call minutes & charges  
  - Customer service calls  
- Churn rate: **~14.5%** (imbalanced)

### Preprocessing Steps  
✔ One-Hot Encoding for categorical features  
✔ StandardScaler for numeric features  
✔ SMOTE for class imbalance  
✔ Remove leakage features in CLV modeling  
✔ Unified preprocessing **Pipelines** for all models

# 🔢 3. Classification Task — Customer Churn Prediction

### Goal  
Predict whether a customer will **churn (1)** or **stay (0)**.

### Why Recall Matters  
Missing a true churner costs the company more than a false alarm.  
Therefore **recall is the primary metric**.

### Models  
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- **Tuned Random Forest**  
- **Deep Learning Classification Model**  

### Summary  
- Best classical model: **Tuned Random Forest**  
- Best overall recall: **Deep Learning Model**  
- Business recommendation → **Deep Learning (maximize detection)**

# 💵 4. Regression Task — Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

### Goal  
Predict **Customer Lifetime Value** → projected revenue per customer.

### Why CLV Matters  
Helps TeleLink optimize:
- Marketing spending  
- Retention budgeting  
- Pricing strategies  
- Revenue forecasting  

### Models  
- **Linear Regression (Best performance)**  
- Gradient Boosting  
- Tuned Gradient Boosting  
- Deep Learning Regression Model

# 🔁 7. How to Reproduce Results

### Classification  
- Run full preprocessing pipeline 
- Apply SMOTE to balance the churn classes 
- Train Tuned RF (RandomizedSearchCV, scoring = F1) / Deep Learning (class weights + threshold = 0.3)
Expected recall:
```
≈ 0.63 (Deep Learning)
```
- Note: Results are reproducible when using fixed random seeds (e.g., random_state=42 and TensorFlow seeds).

### Regression  
- Run preprocessing (same as classification, but without SMOTE)
- Train Linear Regression  
Expected R²:
```
≈ 0.934
```

# 🖥️ 10. How to Use the Web App

1. Open the app : http://www.infosecurity.homes/ 
3. Enter customer details  
4. Click **Analyze Customer**  
5. View:
   - Churn probability  
   - Risk level  
   - CLV prediction  
   - Recommended action  

---

# ⚠️ 11. Current Limitations

- CLV is artificially simulated, not real company data  
- Precision is low in churn model despite strong recall  
- Deep learning models lightly tuned only  
- Some telecom-specific features may not generalize  

---

# 🚀 12. Future Improvements

- Replace simulated CLV with real customer revenue history  
- Tune deep learning layers, dropout, learning rate  
- Use business cost optimization to adjust classification threshold  
- Improve precision while maintaining recall  
- Consider LSTM/Transformers for sequential usage data
